## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I have learned how to center a block on a page using CSS. I have also learned how to use CSS variables.

Here is lines of code I learned.

```css
body {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I need to learn how to build a page that adapts perfectly to different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - This helped me for getting quickly results of what I was looking for. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
